            Born and raised in New Jersey, I am currently pursuing higher education in the intersections of UX/UI design, research, and digital media. Currently as a Drexel University undergraduate student, I spend most of my time in Philadelphia, PA. Most of my academic work is focused on user interface design, user experience design and research. In my free time, I like to paint pet portraits, try different food trucks around the city, and give tours around my college campus as a student ambassador!
