            <p>
                Exploring accessible video game design has become more popular in recent years among game developers. From small indie companies to larger companies like Naughty Dog, accessible game options are starting to appear more frequently and on a larger scale in comparison to previous decades of game development. While many of these accessibility options aided those with visual, auditory, and mobility impairments, game options supporting players with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are limited. This article will explore four of the main symptoms of ASD and corresponding principles of inclusive game design for players on the spectrum. These principles are meant to act as guides for game designers and developers to apply to their video game and encourage accessible features being discussed in the game creation process.
