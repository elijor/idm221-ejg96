    CoSign is a mobile app meant to make learning basic American Sign Language (ASL) easy and fun to learn. Through interactive lessons taught by Deaf instructors, users can pick up conversational ASL to connect and communicate with other ASL users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking inspiration and elements from the app, Lingvano, I created a prototype focused on rebranding and IX for my Interaction Design class. This app introduces basic American Sign Language to new users through lessons and quizzes.

    <h2>
        Why Lingvano?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Lingvano enables more people to learn basic ASL and inspires them to communicate directly with people who primarily use ASL, commonly people who are D/deaf and hard of hearing. Though its mission is admirable, the app's visual design and IX is lacking heavily. For an app that teaches a language heavily based on expressiveness and movement, it could be improved with a new look.

    />
    <p>
        Rebranding Lingvano as Cosign consisted of giving the app a new, more dynamic color scheme, new logo, typography, iconography, and name. The color scheme pictured about adds a an element of contrast and playfulness, which relates to how much expressiveness is utilized when communicating in ASL. The new logo is a simplified version of the sign for "together" which corresponds with the new name's prefix, "Co-". The icons were designed have better consistency with the new logo.
